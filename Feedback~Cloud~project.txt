TITLE: FEEDBACK ON THE CLOUD PROJECTS

NUMBER 1:
Complete of 10-15 selected hands-on labs on Qwiklabs and submitting proof of such per screenshot based on the email received.

The completion of the 10-15 selected hands-on labs on Qwiklabs was done pretty well and the comletion of most labs is 100% so kudos on the good work done mate.
The only way is see a difference in your work is that personally my work was based on every project i did and provided a proof through a screenshot from the email
Qwiklabs provide us with when a lab is completed. Then also i had my images in a folder and submitted.

The README files are awesome..gives a clear explanation of the work done and the person going through your work can get it clearly what you mean and the way 
something worked for you.

The proof provided is convincing...Good luck with the journey to be a cloud engineer.

NUMBER 2:

“Translation” of 2-3 selected labs from Console instructions to 100% command line instructions.

I think in tackling the second challenge..you didn't give a well explained translation off 2-3 translated labs. Mr George Udeson explained the way to do it well
via his youtube channel. I think you should check it out to do it the right way. Otherwise all the best mate
